This is going to be an online system for tutors.

UPDATE: After 2 months of trying to build this in Elm, I conclude that it limits me too much, it makes hard to do simple things, Iâ€™m cut off from the modern Web APIs. I imagine there is a way to do all of these, but it seems like with React and TypeScript I would be much more productive, and get a comparably robust type system to support me. I may get back to this code at some point; just for fun.

I will continue this effort here: https://github.com/gurdiga/repetitor.tsx/.
